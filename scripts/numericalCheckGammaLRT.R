# This script computes the derivative of (1-F(w))/f(w) at a given value for w
# with both numerical and theoretical approach.
# The theoretical steps are shown in  Gamma LRT Appendix.pdf file in Notes folder.
# The numerical calculations are done by numDeriv package in R
# Some of the functions used in this script are shown in section 2.3 of Gamma LRT.pdf file.
# I put a comment in each function to refer to each pdf file.

#? A note about the two branches of W:
#?      lambertWn <= lambertWp
#?      I expect that the one with a "p" is the principal branch. More importantly for us, this determines which is W_l and which is W_u. Just use alphabetical ordering.

#! Warning: lambertWp breaks for arguments too close to -1/e (it doesn't throw an error, it just runs forever). For us, that means we can't evaluate the survival function too close to the upper bound on W. I hope this won't be an issue. Otherwise, we may need to find a different implementation of W_u.
